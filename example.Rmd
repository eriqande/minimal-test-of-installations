```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

If this RMarkdown document knits correctly, then
RStudio, R, and the necessary other packages have been installed
all right.

This is just an example that comes with RStudio

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Checking on running shell commands

Here we will run a shell command that cycles over the numbers
1 to 10 and prints them, just to see if things are working:
```{sh}
for i in {1..10}; do 
  echo "Number $i"
done
```
